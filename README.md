# Missing JavaScript features

This repository provides features on base JavaScript objects that should exist and would avoid reinventing the wheel in every file of our projects.

These features are designed to be used with immutable values, and especially to manage states and computed data in a React application.

Don't hesitate to make pull requests if you want to add or improve some features !
